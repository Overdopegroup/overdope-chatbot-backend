About us:
Overdope began long before it had a name.
‚Äã
Hello, I‚Äôm Alexandros and this story started in Greece in 2002.
 
At just 15 years old, I was renting time in internet caf√©s to download free DAW software to create music. I couldn‚Äôt even save my work, the caf√©s didn‚Äôt allow it. Every session started from scratch. But that didn‚Äôt matter. It wasn‚Äôt about finishing something, it was about the feeling of creating.
‚Äã
After a few months, I started working and saved enough to buy a basic computer, a pair of hi-fi speakers, and a MIDI keyboard. I set up a tiny studio in my bedroom. What I lacked in resources, I made up for in obsession.
Every cent I earned went straight back into gear. Every spare hour was spent learning. I wasn‚Äôt chasing trends. I was chasing fulfillment. 
‚Äã
In my early twenties, I moved to Germany in search of financial stability. I spent my days working long hours as a truck driver. At night, I‚Äôd come home to a modest studio setup in the corner of a room and take on my first clients as a music producer and audio engineer. It wasn‚Äôt glamorous. But it was real. That hunger to create never left me.
‚Äã
Eventually, I moved to Cyprus in 2016 for love.
‚Äã
Hi, I‚Äôm Marianna. That‚Äôs where I come in.
‚Äã
What started as a personal chapter for us quickly became something so much bigger, a shared mission.
‚Äã
I had already spent years as an entrepreneur, working in business management. But more than that, I was a believer. I saw the fire in Alexandros, and I didn‚Äôt just want to support it, I wanted to step into it. So in the process of organizing our  wedding, running my own business, i could not accept that my talented husband will spend his life as a track driver  and  i found a small space rented it out and just brought the news to the table.
His mission was to built the studio and make the most of it. With time I dove in fully, learning the technical side, expanding the vision, and building with him every step of the way.
We didn‚Äôt stop at music. We ventured into photography and video, too.
 
It wasn‚Äôt just his dream anymore. It was ours.
‚Äã
How we ended up with the name "Overdope" and what it means to us:
‚Äã
When we started out, our first project studio had a small recording booth. The only way to record multiple instruments and vocals was by using a technique called overdubbing, layering sounds one at a time to build the full arrangement.
Every time we achieved the sound we were aiming for, we‚Äôd get a rush, that deep feeling of accomplishment that felt like a hit of dopamine.
So, we brought the technical and emotional sides together into one word: Overdope.
It represents both the process and the feeling. Not just the craft, but the joy of creating something real. Even our logo is a combination of a vinyl's round shape and the a part of dopamine's molecule the a benzene ring. So now it makes sense for you too, we hope :)!
‚Äã
We had no investors. No shortcuts. Just the two of us, relentless and aligned. Every skill, recording, mixing, lighting, cinematography, editing, sound design, was self-taught, self-earned, and sharpened through real-world experience.
‚Äã
After working with international and local companies, Alexandros as a video creator and technical lead, and me as a Video production manager,  we decided it was time to bet fully on ourselves.
‚Äã
We found a larger space right next to our tiny studio. It was just a raw, empty shell no insulation, electrical and other  issues, nothing fancy but perfect for us. We saw what it could become. And we built it with our own hands. Wall by wall. Cable by cable. Studio by studio.
‚Äã
Today, Overdope is a 300-square-meter creative hub in Nicosia, a place where content is crafted from scratch under one roof. From podcasts to music videos, from commercial shoots to full music production, we‚Äôve created a home where any creator or brand can walk in and make it real.
‚Äã
Our strength  isn‚Äôt just the gear or the design. It‚Äôs the energy. People walk in and immediately feel safe, because when we take on a project, we commit fully. We‚Äôll go through hell if we have to, but we‚Äôll make sure the goal is reached. We overdeliver, not as a business tactic, but because that‚Äôs just who we are.
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
Over time, we‚Äôve become known in Cyprus‚Äôs creative scene not just as professionals, but as a force, a power couple with a vision, commitment, and integrity that‚Äôs impossible to ignore. Every project is treated like our own. Every client like a partner.
‚Äã
This isn‚Äôt a studio built on hype. It‚Äôs built on heart, sacrifice, risk, resilience and an unstoppable drive to create, the kind that doesn‚Äôt waver, even when the ground shakes.
‚Äã
Overdope isn‚Äôt just a studio. It‚Äôs a story.
‚Äã
And now, you‚Äôre invited to be part of it.
‚Äã
Alexandros & Marianna
