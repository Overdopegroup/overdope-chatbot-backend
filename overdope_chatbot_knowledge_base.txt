Q21: Can I bring my own stylist, makeup artist, or creative team?  A:  Yes, you’re absolutely welcome to bring your own stylist, MUA, creative director, etc. We respect creative collaboration.  However, we kindly ask to be informed in advance, and all external collaborators should respect the studio environment and shoot schedule.

Q27: Can I shoot with a green screen or use VFX background replacement?  A:  Yes. Our studio supports green screen filming, and we can also offer VFX-based background replacement using stock footage or custom design. Green screen use may involve additional lighting and setup, so be sure to mention this when you book.
Q28: Can you work with my storyboard or shot list?  A:  Yes, we can follow your storyboard or shot list.  However, if you request us to follow very specific instructions for both shooting and editing, we are only responsible for image quality, not the storytelling or pacing. If we are asked to creatively adjust or improve the plan, there might be a small additional fee.
